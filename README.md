# Data-Mining-for-purchase-prediction

An overall pineline for data mining, including:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model selection(LR, RandomForest)
4. Cross-validation for parameter searching
5. Feature selection
6. Imbalanced data learning
7. Predict & submission

More advanced learning algorithms and features will be added in the future.
